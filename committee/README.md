# Committee Bylaws

This is how committees operate in the AI Village. See the [bylaws](committee.md) document for how committees function at a interpersonal level. The intention of this document is to outline minimum expectations and mechanisms for operating committees. If a committee is healthy and working towards their goal well, they should not need to consult this document. 

See the [infrastructure](infrastructure.md) document for how the infrastructure operates. This is to document how someone gets the roles and access needed to operate as a committee lead or member. This is just documentation for how to get an AIV email, access to the github organization, and other things needed to volunteer. Unlike the bylaws, it is not meant to be an enforced mechanism, just documentation.

# Expectations

Everyone serving on a committee or volunteering for the village should follow the following additional codes:

## Work Collaboratively 

The AIV is bigger than any one person. You should work in collaboration with everyone here and strive to make everyone's experience enjoyable. One person working on a key task the community needs to accomplish may be fast, but that person can mess up with no recourse. 

Always have a backup, don't announce something we don't know we can deliver, and don't burn yourself out.

## Speak Collaboratively

The AIV is a large platform. Everyone has differing views on what the AIV means and does. We also have differing views on how best to use and secure AI. Any statements about this on behalf of the village need to be made collaboratively. This gets tricky at times, especially on the ground at a convention.

Always respect the community and the hard work of others, don't do or say something to the press that may jeopardize the community. Don't put yourself above everyone else.
