# Committee Bylaws

This is how committees operate in the AI Village. See the [bylaws](committee.md) document for how committees function at a interpersonal level. The intention of this document is to outline minimum expectations and mechanisms for operating committees. If a committee is healthy and working towards their goal well, they should not need to consult this document. The [volunteer code of conduct](volunteer-code-of-conduct.md) is how we like to work. 

See the [infrastructure](infrastructure.md) document for how the infrastructure operates. This is to document how someone gets the roles and access needed to operate as a committee lead or member. This is just documentation for how to get an AIV email, access to the github organization, and other things needed to volunteer. Unlike the bylaws, it is not meant to be an enforced mechanism, just documentation.
