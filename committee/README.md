# Committee Best Practices

## Committee Formation

To form a committee at the AIV you should submit a one page document describing what the committee wants to do, and how. The committee goals and content should align with the AIV's mission. Projects that can be reused at several cons are best, and it's better to not have much on the ground infrastructure.

- Abstract - 1 paragraph about the idea as whole, including why AIV should do it.
- Presentation - 1 paragraph about how con-goers will interact with the content.
- Production - 1 paragraph with some idea of how you'll produce the content.
- Team - a list of team members and how they will contribute.

## Deadlines

The AIV sends in descriptions of what we're bringing to each con as part of the application. The steering committee writes that application for each con, and if your project is in that application, then you have a hard deadline for the project as a whole. This will impose additional smaller hard deadlines. 

It's best to just make stuff without a hard deadline. Hard Deadlines cause stress and crunch. However, if you're going to show your stuff off at a con that con is your deadline and you should really try make it. It is *best* if you get 80% of the project done before you announce it, so that you don't have to crunch too much at the end. Your project can be a surprise, i.e. not included in the application description. This means if you slip and it's not done in time, there's no harm & no foul.  

Soft deadlines are self imposed by the committee and can be delayed. Plenty of small soft deadlines keep everyone honest, it keeps things moving and momentum is very important. You enforce them among yourself and can let them slip. These are really important for keeping the committee healthy and avoiding the common problems.

## Committee Membership

Committees should be as small as possible to do their job. Everyone on the committee should have a defined role or tasks that they are doing to serve. This can be "advisor" if that person is busy and an expert who's advice is necessary. If someone is enthusiastic and inexperienced they might contribute by playtesting, or making website graphics. The committee should be open to people learning new skills while contributing, if it makes sense. 

#### New Members

Committees can recruit actively, or passively. Active recruitment is the committee asking people to join to help with a task. Passive recruitment is posting a list of things they need help with openly and talking to applicants. They should be open to someone offering to do something helpful for the project that isn't on their todo list. 

## Problems in a Committee

The most common problem is not people not doing things, but people not communicating. Serving on a committee means volunteering to help. If a committee member has something happen in their personal or work life, then they should say so. If a committee member is working on something and not saying anything, then the rest don't know what's going on and this makes people nervous. The worst thing is someone ghosting the committee with no info.

The next most common problem is someone not doing what they said they'd do. This is usually because something came up in their personal life. Figure out a work around, or maybe just delay some of the soft deadlines. If there's a hard deadline, then the committee should figure out a plan B. If someone really isn't contributing, it's OK to find someone else. Just be professional about it. Not having soft deadlines makes this problem much harder to deal with.

#### Committee Removal 

If someone signs onto a committee and does not contribute then they should be removed by the committee. This should be done upfront, professionally, and with kindness. It can feel bad to remove a friend from your committee, but usually this decision is made because people on the committee are getting irritated at the "dead weight" who may be getting credit for others work. Try to work with them for a bit, but not too long. If they aren't communicating, then the decision to remove them may be easy. If they are having persistent personal problems then it may be best for them to leave and figure those out. They can come back when they're in a better place.

If someone has done a bunch of work, but wants to move on then the committee can give them "emeritus" status or just thank them and part ways.

# Committee Bylaws & Documentation

This is how committees operate in the AI Village. See the [bylaws](committee.md) document for how committees function at a interpersonal level. The intention of this document is to outline minimum expectations and mechanisms for operating committees. If a committee is healthy and working towards their goal well, they should not need to consult this document. The [volunteer code of conduct](volunteer-code-of-conduct.md) is how we like to work. 

See the [infrastructure](infrastructure.md) document for how the infrastructure operates. This is to document how someone gets the roles and access needed to operate as a committee lead or member. This is just documentation for how to get an AIV email, access to the github organization, and other things needed to volunteer. Unlike the bylaws, it is not meant to be an enforced mechanism, just documentation.
