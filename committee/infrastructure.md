# Infrastructure

This document outlines how access is given to the documents and organizational systems we use. This isn't a legal document, it is meant to be a guide for how to operate as a committee member or chair in the AI Village organization.

## Website

To be listed on the website a committee member needs to provide a bio in the correct format on the AI Village website repository. This may be short and anonymized if the would like. The committee chair must have some presence on the site.
**Instructions for how to do this.**

## Email & Git Access

To get an AIV email they need to contact via email or discord direct message the Webmaster to get an email and github access. You have to be a member of the logistics discord first, and either be a committee chair or have a committee chair vouch for you to get this access.

## Discord & Github Roles

Committee chairs can make chat rooms and roles on discord as needed. They can also request a Github team and a make private repos for that team as needed.
