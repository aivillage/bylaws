# Expectations

Everyone serving on a committee or volunteering for the village should follow the following additional codes:

## Work Collaboratively

The following bullet points have one major caveat: If life gets in the way, be up front about it. We don't need to know the details, but we may need to make a plan B. Just a quick message telling us that you're out of commission is enough. If what you're doing is really important to the village, you should have a backup so that you can dip and do what you need to do. The definition of projects that are "important" is what we've promised to others outside of the community. If we've promised DEFCON something, we need to do our best to do it, but if it's going to be a surprise at DEFCON we can be a bit more relaxed about it. 

- Follow through! If you promised to do something, do your best to do it. 
- Update everyone often! Even a small update regularly sent helps everyone know what's going on.  
- Ask for help! If you're stuck, someone might be able to help. There are a lot of kind smart people in the village.
- Don't oversubscribe! If you know you won't have time to do something don't promise that you'll do it.
- If it's important, have a backup!

The final thing to say about working together is to communicate kindly. We're all volunteers here. Don't boss people about. If someone wants to do something cool and bring it to DEFCON and it's not going to affect others and the rest of the planning, encourage them. Don't denigrate their work. Some people helping out are juniors and don't have the best practices, some are seniors who write excellent code. Be professional and offer constructive criticism if needed.

## Speak Collaboratively

The AIV is a large platform. Everyone has differing views on what the AIV means and does. We also have differing views on how best to use and secure AI. Any statements about this on behalf of the village need to be made collaboratively. This gets tricky at times, especially on the ground at a convention.

- Always respect the community and the hard work of others!
- Don't do or say something to the press that may jeopardize the community. 
- Don't put yourself above everyone else! If many people contributed to a project, give them credit.

The best approach to take with press approaching the village in general at cons is to direct them to the someone on the board or the show runner. They've got the most complete picture of what the village is up to and have experience talking to the press. If the press is approaching about a particular project direct them to the board or the committee who worked on that project.
