# Discord Rules
 
These are in the Discord community space rules section and are agreed to by everyone coming into the server.

1. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.
2. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.
3. No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.
4. If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know. We want this server to be a welcoming space!
5. Don't be the reason we need to make more rules! 

# Suggestions

Conversations are asynchronous, it can be hard to keep up. Here are some suggestions to help people:
- Try not to bury the conversation by sending too many messages at once.
- Keep conversations on topic in their respective room
