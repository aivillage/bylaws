# The AI Village

The AI Village is a community of hackers and data scientists working to educate the world on the use and abuse of artificial intelligence in security and privacy. We want to teach security practitioners how AI works, and data scientists how security works. We also educate the general public about the new risks and issues AI brings.

# Contributing

If you want to do a project in the AI or MLSec space and present it at conventions that requires dedicated convention space then it could be a project we're interested in. If it's something you've already finished then we'd love to take a look. If it's something you want to work on that could be awesome and the community likes you can form a committee with some like minded people. We'll give you some resources to make it happen.

# AI Village Bylaws

The AIV works via a few small groups academics call committees, open source people may call working-groups. Conventions are usually committee based so we use that language in these docs. These committees are autonomous and focused on a single task. Some committees are:

- **Program Committee**: Runs the call for papers and selects the talks.
- **CTF Working Group**: Creates the capture the flag contest and runs it.
- **Workshop Committee**: Creates or solicits workshops and figures out the infrastructure required.
- **Art Committee**: Creates or solicits AI Art to be shown at conventions, like the StableDiffusion booth. 

We've had committees doing a podcast, and ones making [disinformation games for kids](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/at-def-con-teaching-disinformation-campaigns-is-childs-play/). The steering committee glues this all together and writes the applications and description of the AIV at the various cons. They approve new committees and allocate resources. See the [best practices document](/committee/committee_best_practices.md) for how to form a committee and help out.

# Repo Layout

There are 3 types of documents in this repo. We have committee bylaws in [committee](/committee/committee.md). These are enforced by us as a community and are our main mechanism for holding each other accountable. We also have documentation for how to do things around the village. 

- [Discord Code of Conduct](discord-coc.md)
- [Conference Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
- [Volunteer Code of Conduct](/committee/volunteer-code-of-conduct.md)
- [Committee Bylaws](/committee/committee.md)

The legally binding bylaws for running the non-profit are in [non-profit](/non-profit/README.md). These are reviewed by our lawyers and other institutions.
