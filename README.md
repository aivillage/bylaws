# DRAFT: AI Village Bylaws

**These are a draft and have yet to be approved. This will be open for comments and PRs on August 26th 2022, and the current AIV board will vote to approve on September 30th 2022. From that point on changes will be made according to the rules outlined within.**

There are 3 types of documents in this repo. The legally binding bylaws for running the non-profit are in [non-profit](/non-profit/README.md). These are reviewed by our lawyers and other institutions. We have non-legally binding committee bylaws in [committee](/committee/committee.md). These are enforced by us as a community and are our main mechanism for holding each other accountable. The last type of document is documentation and guides for how to onboard and help out.
